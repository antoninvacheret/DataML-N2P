# DataML-N2P
Data Analysis and Machine Learning course for the Erasmus Mundus Degree in Nuclear Physics.

## Teaching progam 

### Session 1 : Introduction to the Course and machine learning in N&P Physics

course :
in this session we will start with a brief overviez of machine learning over the last 40 years and type of machine learning and developments in AI. Type of machine learning tasks and where AI is used in theoritical and experimental physics. 
in a second part we will review the use of python libraries used for data analysis and ML. small examples of pandas, get used to the environment provided, tests some simple code to explore some data. Use of github repository - to later provide project on the repo
introduction to tensors in pytorch - numpy etc

practical session : 
continue with exercises  

### Session 2 : Data manipulation, visualisation, basics of data analysis, intro to tensors 
course : introduction to the pdml_extended datasets, visualisation methods, applying selection cuts, correlations, embedding visualisation algorithms. more examples from pandas - introduction to streamlit / plotly / seaborn for interactive plots. Example of how to prepare a labelled dataset

practicals :
study another type of datasets : time series of pulses 
look at averaging the pulses, visualise each categories, represent those categories and connect to raw data - present on webpage

### Session 3 : Learning from data, Linear Regression, Shallow and deep NN  
course : introduction to supervised learning, loss function, linear regression, shallow NN and activation functions. Deep NN and look at a first training workflow. 

practicals : building a simple NN to perform a classification. learn how to build a NN in scikit learn and pytorch and train the model on one of the datasets seen previously. 
look at effects of changing the number of neurons.

### Session 4 : Applications to classification and regression tasks  

course : look at classification tasks and common issues in physics data, extension to anomaly detection. Regression tasks, examples of determining energy, quantification of errors, interpretability of results. Relation between classification and regression tasks. confusion matrix, 

practicals : compare shallow and deep NN. Look at effect of type of loss function. accuracy, confusion matrix, decision - tradeoff between accuracy and purity, comparison of ROC curve between simple cut selection and NN. 

### Session 5 : Training, optimisation, ensembling & interpretation 
course : how to design the best model ? no free lunch theorem review of training and optimisation of architectures. random search, bayesian optimisation. model scaling qnd compute power 
Ensembling methods and algorithms, BDTs, ensembles of NN. Methods to interpret the data  

practicals:

### Session 6 : Deep learning layers and other model architectures

### Session 7 : ODE Solvers

### Session 8 : Transformers and foundation models

### Session 9 : Hypothesis testing I

### Session 10 : Hythesis testing II
