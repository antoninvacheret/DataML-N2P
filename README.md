# DataML-N2P
Data Analysis and Machine Learning course for the Erasmus Mundus Degree in Nuclear Physics.

## Teaching progam 

### Session 1 : Introduction to the Course and machine learning in N&P Physics
in this session we will start with a brief overviez of machine learning over the last 40 years and type of machine learning and developments in AI. Type of machine learning tasks and where AI is used in theoritical and experimental physics. 

in a second part we will review the use of python libraries used for data analysis and ML. small examples of pandas, get used to the environment provided, tests some simple code to explore some data. Use of github repository - to later provide project on the repo
